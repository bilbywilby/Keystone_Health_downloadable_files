Keystone Health Forensic Navigator — Compliance Audit & Operational Mapping
Document Control: Technical Verification & Medical Billing Advocacy Integration Report Target Architecture: Keystone Health Forensic Navigator (v1.3 audit checklist) Jurisdictional Layer: Federal (NSA, ERISA, HIPAA, FDCPA/Reg F) + Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (FCEUA, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5525)
Executive Summary & System Compatibility
The Keystone Health Forensic Navigator Compliance Reference Framework (v1.3) establishes a deterministic, immutable audit system for medical billing, claims adjudication, and health data governance. By combining cryptographic chain-of-custody logging (prev_record_hash / RFC 3161 TSA) with strict regulatory mappings (No Surprises Act, ERISA, FDCPA, HIPAA), the system provides an audit-proof ledger for patient financial advocacy and billing forensics.
This document synthesizes Keystone’s regulatory controls with real-world medical billing audit protocols, establishing direct operational mappings for pre-service estimations, forensic Explanation of Benefits (EOB) audits, and balance billing dispute resolutions.

Data Governance & Cryptographic Chain Architecture
To maintain forensic integrity under audit conditions, the system implements a immutable ledger pattern for all medical billing and PHI interaction logs.

Mandatory Fail-Stop (FS) System Triggers
Automated automated execution must halt upon encountering any of the following conditions:
FS1 (Chain Corruption): Any hash mismatch in prev_record_hash \rightarrow Immediate system halt; escalate to CTO/CCO.
FS2 (Timestamp Loss): Missing tsa_token on >5\% of critical records \rightarrow Batch quarantine; escalate to SecOps.
FS3 (Retention Misclassification): Misclassified retention trigger on >2\% of records (0\% tolerance during active migration) \rightarrow Route to manual review queue.
FS4 (Plaintext PHI Exposure): Detection of encryption_state == plaintext on any external boundary \rightarrow Security incident ticket; escalate to CISO.
FS5 (Missing Benchmark Vintage): Null value for benchmark_vintage during QPA/IDR calculation \rightarrow Reject output; escalate to Pricing Analytics Lead.
Forensic Billing Audit & Cost Calculation Protocols
1. Pre-Service Cost Projection Formula
For planned clinical encounters, total patient out-of-pocket (OOP) exposure is modeled as:
\text{Total OOP} = \min\left( \text{OOP}_{\text{Max}} - \text{OOP}_{\text{YTD}}, \quad \text{Deductible}_{\text{Rem}} + \left[ (\text{Billed Charge} \times \text{Contracted Ratio}) - \text{Deductible}_{\text{Rem}} \right] \times \text{Coinsurance } \% \right) + \text{Facility Fees} + \text{Anesthesia Fees}
Where:
\text{Deductible}_{\text{Rem}} = \max(0, \text{Deductible}_{\text{Total}} - \text{Deductible}_{\text{Paid YTD}})
\text{Allowed Amount} = \text{RVU}_{\text{Total}} \times \text{GPCI}_{\text{Geographic}} \times \text{Conversion Factor}
2. Forensic EOB Audit Workflow
When auditing an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or medical statement:
CPT/HCPCS Verification: Cross-reference billed CPT codes against the plan’s Evidence of Coverage (EOC) schedule for the designated Place of Service (POS) (e.g., POS 11 Office vs. POS 22 Outpatient Hospital).
Preventive vs. Diagnostic Flagging: Ensure 100% preventive coverage under ACA guidelines for qualifying CPT codes (e.g., screening colonoscopies CPT 45378). Reclassify incorrect diagnostic billing conversions.
Balance Billing Detection: Identify if out-of-network providers at in-network facilities billed charges exceeding the Qualifying Payment Amount (QPA). Flag violations under NSA 45 CFR § 149.410.
Unbundling & Upcoding Analysis: Audit claims against NCCI edits to detect unbundled panel components or artificially elevated evaluation and management (E/M) service tiers.

Actionable Strategy Checklist
[ ] Validate Q4 Deductible Accelerators: Check if YTD Out-of-Pocket Maximum is satisfied. If met, schedule pending elective procedures, diagnostic screenings, and specialist consultations prior to January 1 plan reset.
[ ] Execute PII/PHI Scrubbing: Run local HMAC-SHA256 scrubbing prior to transmitting claims data across external analytical endpoints.
[ ] Issue Balance Billing Disputes: If balance-billed for emergency or non-emergency OON care at an in-network facility, dispatch formal NSA Dispute Notice citing 45 CFR § 149.410.
